**Turn Browser Chaos into Calm — Save, Organize, and Restore Your Tabs Across Devices**

---

## 🚀 About

I used to tell myself: *“I’ll just open the browser for 5 minutes of work.”*

But 5 minutes became 30… 30 became an hour… and before I knew it, I was staring at **37 tabs** competing for my attention:

✉️ Gmail pinged with unread emails  
🔨 GitHub project I promised myself I’d finish later  
🗑 Notion page with research notes I swore I’d check quickly  
🔨 Reddit threads I “just wanted to peek at”  
🎥 YouTube whispered: “one more tutorial won’t hurt”

It felt productive, but my focus had quietly slipped away. Bookmarks didn’t save me either — hundreds of “check later” links piling up.

Then I noticed a friend’s workflow: separate desktops for **projects, learning, personal browsing** — neat, organized, and stress-free.

💡 That’s when I thought: *“Why can’t browsers work like that too?”*

**TabKeep** was born — a lightweight Microsoft Edge extension that lets you **keep all your tabs into named sessions, restore them instantly, and sync them across devices**.

Stop losing focus. Stop losing tabs. Bring order to your browser, wherever you are.
